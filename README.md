##HIT-OSLab

Um...

Congratulations, you've found me...If you think this repository a salvation for your homework, you can leave right now...However, if you want to know what are right answers, these are great references..

There are 7 branches here, master branch is original, and other branches stand for different labs. I believe the labs are developed by Sunner, he is an honorable teacher in HIT who I donnot want any of you to demoralize him. 

So you should not just download this code as your homework. Have good time with OS..

All of the codes passed my test, and commits with latest "over" message can be nicely running on my machine.

(This is a hodgepodge of all the HIT alumnus, ~~to be honest I don't think to put my code here is a good idea..~~)
